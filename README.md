# The Steeple Project

The Steeple Project is envisioned as a customizable and flexible church management system that blends easy-to-use interfaces with open data sources and APIs. One of the primary reasons for initiating the Steeple Project was that although many tools and programs were available for churches to use in a variety of logistical management and communication purposes, most had either painfully frustrating interfaces or were so complex and generic (and often expensive) that the simple functionality was lost.

## Objectives

The objectives of the Steeple Project are to create church management software that is:

1. Fast - I want to be able to both add and retrieve data quickly.
2. Intuitive - I don't want to fight with an interface to find what I'm looking for.
3. Clean - Let's keep it light and simple -- I don't want distractions or overly busy menus or options when I'm working.
4. Modular - I may want to track donations to the church or I may not want to -- let me pick what I want to work with.

## Notes

Please be aware that as the primary developer I'm somewhat new to Ruby on Rails and Git and very new to distributed development on Github. I would ask for some grace as it relates to best practices for development of this project and would be grateful for any suggestions not only to the code or features of the web application but to my process as well.
